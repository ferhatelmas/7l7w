_The Pragmatic Programmer_ recommends to learn a new language every year but this rate is slow a bit compared the speed of advancement in the technology. Therefore, I saw _Seven languages in Seven Weeks_ and I will give it a try. I know one week isn't enough to learn a new language but it is enough to get the notion of what it can be used for, how it looks like and get the confidence to use later in some context.
